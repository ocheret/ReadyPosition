Build Instructions for ReadyPosition
------------------------------------

From the readyposition directory at the root of the working area (containing
build.xml and common.xml), execute...

  $ ant pure jar javadoc

This will clean up any old build artifacts.  It will also do code
generation, compilation, unit testing, build jar files, and generate
javadoc.

The resulting jar files can be found in Build_<username>/lib (e.g.
Build_chuck/lib).  The resulting javaodc tree will be under
Build_<username>/javadoc.
